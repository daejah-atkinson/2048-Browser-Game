# 2048 Browser Game

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p> 2048 is a single player game where you combine numbered tiles on a game board to create a tile with the sum of the two numbers that were slid together. Keep combining the tiles until you create a tile totaling 2048, once you've done this you win. If you fill the entire game board and can no longer slide tiles together, you lose. </p>

<h2> User Story </h2>
<p> <ul>
  <li> As a user, I want to be able to slide the tiles using the arrow keys. </li>
  <li> As a user, I want the two tiles with the same number, when slid together, to automatically combine revealing a new tile with their sum.</li>
  <li> As a user, I want to know when I've won the game by creating tile 2048.</li>
  <li> As a user, I want to know when I've lost the game when the board is full.</li>
    </ul>

<h2> Next Steps </h2>
<p> Plans I have to enhance this game in the future:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow for user to continue playing the game past 2048</li>
  <li>Allow for user to choose the colors of their game tiles based off of theme packages</li>
  </ul>
